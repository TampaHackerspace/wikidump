Note: The most recent release as of 2016-July-4 appears to be openscad-2015.03-3.  Linux repos, even the PPAs, are likely out of date and don't support all the features discussed in the online manual.  Consider installing from the source file [http://files.openscad.org/ Linux tar.gz] if you want a more recent official version.  If you want the bleeding edge, install from the github repo: [https://github.com/openscad/openscad  https://github.com/openscad/openscad].
